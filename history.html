<p style="color: aliceblue"> Before we jump into the Russian Revolution and the whole debate about the Grand Dutchess' escape theory, we need to go way back in time to the vikings. </p>
    
<p style="color: aliceblue">Unusually for the Vikings, trade rather than plunder is the main reason for their penetration deep into Russia during the 9th century AD. The rivers of eastern Europe, flowing north and south, make it surprisingly easy for goods to travel between the Baltic and the Black Sea.</p>

<p style="color: aliceblue">One spot is particularly well-favoured as a trading centre. Near Lake Ilmen the headwaters of the Dvina, Dnieper and Volga rivers are close to each other. Respectively they flow into the Baltic, the Black Sea and the Caspian. Goods ferried by water between these important trading regions converge on this area. By the early 9th century Viking tribes known as the Rus have a base on the site of Novgorod.</p>
